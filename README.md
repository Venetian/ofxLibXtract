============

LibXtract example for openFrameworks

Spectral centroid and MFCCs giving output - requires checking

to compile -
1. grab LibXtract from Github
add the entire LibXtract/src to the project

2. take an empty example - throw out the testApp.h and .cpp files from the src folder and replace with the files here:
testApp.h/cpp
libXtract.h and cpp

It should be that simple
